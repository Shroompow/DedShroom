# Contributing

So you want to contribute to this project? GREAT! Help is much appreciated in the hive!

But before connecting to our roots please read these guidelines so we can maintain our code-standards.

### Code Style

- We use **semicolons**
- Synchronous calls can halt the runtime, increasing the bots response-times. Prefer **asynchronous calls**.
